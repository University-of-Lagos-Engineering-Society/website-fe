/**
 * The ULES Bi-weekly Digest archive.
 *
 * Same shape as `HIGHLIGHTED_EVENT_ITEMS`: numeric `id`, `slug` for the detail
 * route, nested `details` for card-facing copy, `imageUrl`/`imageAlt` at the
 * top level. `details.body` is the full article, newline-delimited — the detail
 * page splits it into blocks the same way the event detail page splits its
 * description.
 *
 * Ordered newest-first, so the index reads chronologically and the home page
 * can take the first two without re-sorting. There's no `timestamp` field
 * (unlike events, which need one for `isEventPast`) — `date` is display copy
 * only, so ordering lives in the array itself.
