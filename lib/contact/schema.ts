/**
 * Client-side validation for the FAQ contact form.
 *
 * This catches mistakes before a request goes out — it is not a security
 * boundary. The backend re-validates everything.
 *
 * Note the deliberate asymmetry with the API error contract: this can surface
 * all three field errors at once, while the API returns one at a time. That's
 * consistent rather than contradictory — by the time a request is sent the
 * client has cleared every rule it knows about, so a server error is the
 * exception case, not a list to work through.
 *
 * Written against the Zod 3 API (`z.string().email()`), which is still valid in
 * Zod 4 — so this works on both without a version check.
